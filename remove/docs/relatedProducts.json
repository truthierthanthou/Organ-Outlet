    "description":"A tribute to the Founder of Hennessy, Richard Hennessy is a unique assemblage of more than 100 of the most exceptional eaux-de-vie, matured to the fullest. The oldest of these are extremely rare, and some date from the early 19th century. Balanced and complex, the rich bouquet slowly releases a succession of aromas that have built up over the years: vanilla, spices, pepper and delicately fragrant flowers. In the mouth, the infinitely refined texture reveals an extraordinary palette of flavors that blends spices, the subtle essence of ripe fruit and the finesse of oak. Savor this exquisite cognac in a crystal tulip-shaped taster’s glass or a small snifter to allow the gradual release of the aromas.",
