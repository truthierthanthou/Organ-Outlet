About the project
Organ Outlet is a platform for finding kidney sellers or “donors” all around the world, while highlighting the commodification of living people into individual body parts. It uses a satirical tone to make a heavy subject more accessible to the interactor while using current web and shopping conventions to convey a sense of irony and reflexivity about our current consumer practices. While the site itself is meant to be humorous, the information conveyed in the site is based on aggregating data from books and online articles on the global organ trade.

Context
Transplant commercialism refers to the exchange of money for the procurement of organs between a recipient or donor, usually done through brokers, while transplant tourism occurs when people travel outside their country to procure an organ. (http://www.declarationofistanbul.org/) This practice requires a complex network of brokers, international patients, willing or not-so-willing sellers and medical professionals. 

Globally, at least 200,000 people are on waiting lists for kidneys. (http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/1/07-020107/en/)
In 2012, 114,690 organs were reported to be transplanted. This only satisfies 10% of the global need. http://newint.org/features/2014/05/01/organ-trafficking-keynote
Around 10,000 organs are illegally sold globally each year according to the group Organs Watch. http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/85/1/07-020107/en/

Inevitably the economically desperate and the vulnerable are the ones who end up selling their organs - the poor, people recovering from disasters (http://www.npr.org/2011/06/10/136931615/blood-bones-and-organs-the-gruesome-red-market), victims of war (http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/the-illegal-trade-in-organ-is-fueled-by-desperation-and-growing-a-847473-3.html) and political oppression (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Falun_Gong). Anthropologist Nancy Scheper-Hughes summarizes the supply chain of organs as coming "from South to North, from Third to First World, from poor to rich, from black and brown to white and from female to male". Brokers are central to linking the different players, organizing travel services that include travel accommodations, medical testing and bribes for 100,000 to 200,000 dollars. http://newint.org/features/2014/05/01/organ-trafficking-keynote

Reasons for participating in the organ trade
- Dialysis is expensive, risky and taxing
- Rising levels of diabetes and heart diseases
- Long transplant lists
- Legal restrictions per country
- Cultural narratives ("saving my family", "sacrifice")

Risks to donors
Not enough information about long-term effects (e.g., poor health, inability to perform physically demanding jobs)
Lack of post-operation medical care
Social ostracism
Decreased physical and mental well-being
Coercion, trickery and manipulation (e.g., getting cheated out of their pay)
Money spent very quickly; low return-on-investment

Risks to receivers
Donors themselves forge their identities so they can participate in the system, leading to high risks for the receiver
Medical complications for receivers (e.g., HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses)
Expensive anti-rejection drugs that lower immune system 

What's next
While there are many debates over the ethical issues of organ trade - as to whether regulation or banning is the solution - the demand for organs, whether for scientific or medical reasons - will not go away. While we seek ways on how to 
provides greater equity for the donors and receivers, altruistic organ donation (
